error.jdk.debug.symbols=JDK debugging symbols do not appear to be installed. Debug symbols provide detailed information in the fatal error log critical for analysis of issues involving VM code. It is recommended to reproduce the issue with the JDK debug symbols installed. Reference: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5419761
error.jna=The crash is happening in JNA code. JNA is not part of the Java JDK. The JNA library is distributed with the application and is therefore application code and not supported by the JDK vendor. Next steps for troubleshooting should be from the JNA vendor. The JDK vendor will provide support for the underlying JDK if the JNA vendor finds an issue with a valid/supported use case.
error.jna.rh=The crash is happening in JNA code. JNA is not part of the Java JDK. The JNA library is distributed with the application and is therefore application code and not supported by Red Hat. Next steps for troubleshooting should be from the JNA vendor. Red Hat will provide support for the underlying JDK if the JNA vendor finds an issue with a valid/supported use case.
error.jdk8.zipfile.contention=There is an application/process bug or invalid use case resulting in an attempt to modify a file Java has it open. Address application code/processes to prevent this unreliable/invalid use case. A workaround to avoid the crash is to disable memory mapping in ZipFile with -Dsun.zip.disableMemoryMapping=true (at the cost of some loss in performance), or upgrade to JDK 11. The OpenJDK developers have determined this is too risky to fix and it is best to address the primary application/process issue. References: (1) https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65104.
